LDM - Ashlanders
by Lucevar 

Requirements
==================================================
-- Requires Patch for Purists to work as expected. You can remove the dependency in Wrye Mash if you don't use PfP, but some things will not work properly (eg Yakum Hairshashashi won't have a nolore script attached, so some of his responses will still be in regular style rather than his broken speech).

Features - Overview
==================================================
-- Filled in some gaps in Yakum Hairshashishi's dialogue. He should no longer switch randomly between broken and perfect Tamrielic (as long as you're using PfP, which gives him a nolore script)
-- some new class-filtered little advice responses + one vanilla line filtered to just hunters
-- the miners in Yanemus now have greetings depending on faction / MQ status. They also now have a little secret variant for the Nerevarine.
-- Ababael Timsar-Dadisun will reveal a little secret to the Nerevarine, if you have a very high disposition with him.
-- The Ashlanders at Ghostgate have a tiny amount of new dialogue explaining why the Wise Woman they have with them couldn't cure Assantus
-- Some Argonian-specific lines for the "arrange a meeting" MG quest
-- a new greeting and response to "Second trial" if the PC talks to Nibani Maesa while afflicted with Corprus
-- Scouts have a lot of dialogue about ashlanders, but there's no dialogue specific to *Ashlander* scouts, so for a number of topics they'll talk as though they're not ashlanders. This mod adds ashlander-suited responses to those topics.

Changelog
=============================================
v1.1
-- Fixed a typo in a vanilla Ashlander line in "Morrowind" topic. 

Features - Detailed Change List v1.0
==========================================================
=========== Ashlanders ==================

[[ little advice ]]
-- one of the ashlander little advice lines is now filtered for class = hunter. It doesn't fit healer/wise woman/other classes of ashlander so well.
----- "No one will ever grow rich hunting. But it is a pure pleasure for itself. Take your time. Sneak up on your prey. Surprise it with a swift, silent arrow. There is no greater pleasure than to drop a cliff racer with a single arrow."
-- added a new line for herders
---- "It is a foolish herder who must beat his guar to control them. Nix-hounds can be tamed or drawn off with bribes of meat. But alit and kagouti you must run from, or bring the tribe's hunters to fight them. And people, they are not so different to beasts, I think. It is dangerous to mistake a kagouti for a guar."
-- added a new line for wise woman and wise woman service classes
---- "When you do not know the path, it is wise to seek counsel from those who have gone before. The ancestors and elders, or those who have long training in their craft, all these may guide you, if you are not too proud to ask."

====================== Ashlander Scouts ==================================
Except where otherwise noted, I added a variant line filtered for scouts who are members of the Ashlander faction.

[[ Ashlander courtesy ]]
[[ Ashlander customs ]]
[[ Ashlander nomadic camps ]]
[[ Ashlanders ]]
[[ Ashlanders hate foreigners ]]
[[ Ashlands ]]
[[ blight diseases ]]
[[ Boots of the Apostle ]]
-- Ashlander scouts will only help you if they have a high disposition. Otherwise, they'll refuse to help you on your quest to find an artifact of the foreign gods.
[[ foyada ]]
[[ foyada mamaea ]]
[[ geographic regions ]]
[[ geography of Morrowind ]]
[[ Lost Kogoruhn ]]
[[ More Blight Storms ]]
[[ my trade ]]
[[ Nerevarine cult ]]
[[ Padomaic ocean ]]
-- filtered for not faction = ashlanders
[[ Ring of the Wind ]]
[[ Sea of Ghosts ]]
[[ Sheogorad ]]
[[ Skull-Crusher ]]
[[ Telvanni tower ]]
-- adds a line for ashlander scouts, and a unique line for the ashlander scout in Vos.
[[ visiting an Ashlander camp ]]
[[ Vvardenfell ]]
[[ Vvardenfell district ]]

===================== Yanemus Mine =====================================

[[ greeting 4 ]]
-- adds a variety of greetings dependent on MQ progression to the Zainab miners in Yanemus mine. Placed in between corprus and blight disease greetings; the player is very likely to pick up diseases getting here, and if they're willing to sneak around on Red Mountain they're probably not too freaked out by disease.
---- base greeting
---- House Hlaalu, Ashlander ebony complete
---- MQ: named clanfriend of the Urshilaku
---- MQ: named Nerevarine by the Zainab
---- MQ: slain Dagoth Ur
---- MQ: killed one of the Zainab

[[ little secret ]]
-- the ashlanders in the mine already had a unique "little secret" entry.
---- added a similar entry, but flavoured for PC = nerevarine.

====================== Ababael Timsar-Dadisun ============================

[[ little secret ]]
-- After the PC becomes Zainab Nerevarine, with very high disposition, Ababael may tell them part of the secret of how he became so wealthy.


====================== Ashlander group at Ghostgate =========================

-- makes Zallit Assattadaishah a member of the Ashlander faction, like the others in the camp.

[[ my trade ]]
-- Added a note to Tunipy's my trade line to say that she's relatively inexperienced, to explain why she hasn't been able to heal Assantus.
----- "We might be outcast, but I am a wise woman. I am councilor to my tribe, small as it is. I am the guardian of secret knowledge, spirit guide and seer into the world unseen. I can tell you about the ancestors, and about Ashlander customs. I know much. But there is much I have yet to learn. To my shame, I am not skilled in healing arts."

[[ droops ]]
-- edits Assantus's line "Yes, but I am outcast. The Wise Women will not cure me." to this:
---- "Yes, but I am outcast. The Wise Women will not cure me. Tunipy would cure me, but she does not know the right herbs and rituals."

======================= Manirai ============================

[[ arrange a meeting ]]
-- adds a new line if the player is an Argonian AND has been named Erabenimsun Nerevarine. In these conditions, she'll be slightly more polite about it than if you're not the Nerevarine.

============= Nibani Maesa ===================
-- Adds a greeting if the PC has talked to Nibani about possibly being the Nerevarine, and has corprus.
--- "You bear the corprus curse. I do not know what this means. Perhaps it is a sign of the Second Trial. Perhaps it means nothing."

[[ Second Trial ]]
-- Adds a line if the PC talks to Nibani while afflicted with Corprus.
---- "These growths and sores, this is the Curse-of-Flesh. Corprus disease. If you are the Nerevarine, you will find a way to break this curse to pass the Second Trial. Or perhaps you are not the Nerevarine, and you should make your goodbyes before the curse steals your mind as well as your flesh."

[[ arrange a meeting ]]
-- "The Urshilaku will never meet with an Argonian sorcerer" -> Nibani will say this even if you're an Argonian sorcerer yourself. LDM adds a new line for Argonian pcs who are Nerevarine. If you're not Argonian or not the Nerevarine, she still doesn't care about being racist to your face.

==== Yakum Hairshashishi =========

Soul sickness: 
-- vanilla pre-C3_destroyDagoth line filtered for speechcraft > 30
-- added new, less-info line for speechcraft < 30
---- "In ashlands, bad magic in dust. Bring sickness, bad dreams. No sleep. All time tired. Some time crazy, angry. Here, no."

Nels Llendo:
-- Yakum has his own response now.

Nelos Onmar:
-- Yakum has his own response now.

[[ blight storms ]]
-- vanilla pre-C3_destroyDagoth line filtered for speechcraft > 30
-- added new, less-info line for speechcraft < 30
----- "Sharmat send storms to ashlands, bad magic. Dust in every place. People, guar, kwama, all crazy, all bite and fight. Hard times for ashlanders. Here, not so hard."

[[ ashlanders ]]
-- vanilla pre-C3_destroyDagoth line filtered for speechcraft > 30:
-- added new, less-info line for speechcraft < 30
"We hunt, herd guar. Honor ancestors. Move always. No house, only yurt. Me, I herd guar. Then blight storms and soul sickness come. Now, no guar. I come here. Work, fight, make gold. Become rich like great trader."

[[ greeting 2 ]]
-- Yakum now has his own vampire greeting
-- Yakum now has his own nudity greeting

[[ greeting 4 ]]
-- Yakum now has his own common disease greeting
-- Yakum now has his own blight disease greeting
-- Yakum now has his own corprus disease greeting
-- Yakum now has his own pc = outlaw greeting
