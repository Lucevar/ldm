=============== Optional Worldspace Edit: Fargoth's Ring Unbarrelled ===============
-- Moves Fargoth's ring from the barrel into the worldspace, placing it half-sunk beside the barrel. This way your character can just happen to notice it as they pass, instead of being obliged to poke around in other people's belongings. 

Optional because it will conflict with some Seyda Neen mods that dramatically change the landscape (eg Seyda Neen - Imperial Port by Aitrus).

=============== Optional Worldspace Edit: Nine-Holes at Arrille's ===============
Requirements:
OAAB_Data
Tamriel_Data 

-- Added nine-holes board and various other gambling paraphernalia to Arrille's
-- A little bit of additional misc OAAB/TD clutter
