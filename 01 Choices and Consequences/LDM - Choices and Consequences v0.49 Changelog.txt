LDM - Choices and Consequences
v0.49 ALPHA

You will need to remove any of the mods listed in the "Included Mods" section and start a new game for the changes in this mod to work correctly.

Installation
======================================================
Requirements:
- Either MCP with Allow Faction Leaving patch enabled, or OpenMW 0.46+

Load Order:

- Django's Dialogue.esp
- Improved Inns Expanded.esp
- LDM - Context Matters.esp
- LDM - Choices & Consequences.esp

Partially Included Mods
========================================================
Hlaalu Rank Adjust by Ithilien87 - LDM includes only the NPC rank and "background" topic changes from Hlaalu Rank Adjust. Compatible if you load Hlaalu Rank Adjust after LDM - C&C for the full Hlaalu Rank Adjust changes.
Sexual Harassment Remover by JaceyS 
- I only included the quest changes/additions. SHR is incredibly modular, so you can pick and choose from any of the other SHR modules and load them alongside C&C, just don't use any of the modules that affect the Telvanni Bride quest, Crassius Curio, or Nels Llendo.

Compatibility
=======================================================
-- Django's Dialogue should load BEFORE LDM - Context Matters
-- Improved Inns Expanded should load BEFORE LDM - Choices and Consequences
-- Hlaalu Rank Adjust should load AFTER LDM - Choices and Consequences

Mods that Conflict
=======================================================
- Anything on the "included mods" list
- Andrano Ancestral Tomb Remastered - GAMA. Situational conflict where Nelos Onmar may become temporarily unavailable, thus leading to a dead end in the AATR quest. It is possible to still complete the Andrano quests via other methods.

Recommended Mods
========================================================
- MWSE Pickpocket and Stealth Improved by Mort - Makes pickpocketing and stealth actually functional, thus providing pacifist options in a LOT of different scenarios. 
- Roleplay Options for Great House Hlaalu by Caeris & Luj1
- Courtesy by Chantox
- Nationalist Nerevarine by Alice
- Religions Elaborated by Caeris - use the No Quest Changes version

High Level Feature Changes in 0.49
=======================================================

[ MISC: Death of a Tax Man]
-- Gave Arrille a unique line that gives RPers a plausible excuse to report the death even if they're not playing particularly law-abiding characters 

[ Ahnassi ]
-- Ahnassi will put her Flamemirror Robe on when you give it to her
-- Fixed a line where Ahnassi referred to a female special friend as male. 

[ MQ: Telvanni Bride ]
-- Assorted typo fixes
-- Changed filtering on Reytha's dialogue so you can start her questline even if you haven't spoken to Sonummu. This matches vanilla dialogue that lets you ask various Telvanni about it (and I recommend doing so - the vanilla dialogue is hilarious)
-- Gave Reytha an LDM id
-- Set Reytha's AIWander to 0 to prevent her from wandering into tables constantly.

* [Greeting 5]
-- Tweaked some of Drerel Indaren's dialogue to flow better.

* [ latest rumors ]
-- Added some variants to Surane Leoriane's latest rumor entry, acknowledging your actions around Caldera. If you get Odral Helvi arrested, she'll mention that. If you shut the Caldera mine down, she'll also mention that. Thanks to Alice for the suggestion.

[ MISC: MV_VictimRomance ]
* [ jewels ]
-- Added the option to tell Maurrie that you understand her perfectly, if you kissed Nels Llendo.

[ GAMA_ShatteredDreams ]
-- Minor journal text tweak

[ Nels Llendo ]
-- Gave Nels a new script
-- He'll now appear next to Nelos instead of creeping behind Samia. I got annoyed at accidentally clicking her instead of him.
-- Added three new methods of dealing with Nels: as a woman, pretend to be enthusiastic and steal his purse (if you have enough sneak skill). Unisex: With level > 10, intimidate him into not demanding anything.

* [Greeting 5]
-- Added a new greeting to him when he's hanging about on the road after accosting you.

* [ MV_3_Charming]
-- Added journal entries to support the new quest paths

* [ note from Nelos ]
-- Nels will now comment on the note.

* [ Nels Llendo ]
-- Minor tweaks to vanilla dialogue
-- Added unique lines for many of the characters in the Halfway.

* [ local news ]
-- Added a new topic, local news, so I can write location/quest specific rumors without worrying about compatibility in 'latest rumors'
-- Added a rumor about Nels Llendo, so that vanilla dialogue shows up even if you haven't met him yet

* [ thieves guild ]
-- added some commentary to Nels; changes depending on whether the PC is a member of the guild or not.

* [ greetings 4 ]
-- Added a bunch of unique greetings to Nels when he's hanging about in the tavern. Mostly flavour commentary, but he might give you gifts or take money off you. 

[ Telvanni: Mages Guild Monopoly ]
-- Found a new place for Areach the sorceror to appear, as his old home in the Madach Tradehouse conflicts with HOTV/BCOM.  

[ Imperial Legion: Land Deed ]
-- Changed spear reward to an OAAB Imperial Spear.
-- Fixed bug where Darius wouldn't actually give you the reward or close the quest.

[ House Redoran: Hostile Mudcrabs ]
-- The corpse of the guar will now disappear after you kill the hostile mudcrabs and turn the quest in to Drulene.

## Credits
* Caleb - suggesting that Ahnassi put on her robe
* Remiros for the unreleased mod I based the new Nels quest choices on.
