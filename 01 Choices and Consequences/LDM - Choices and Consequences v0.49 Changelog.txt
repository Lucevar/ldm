LDM - Choices and Consequences
v0.49 ALPHA

You will need to remove any of the mods listed in the "Included Mods" section and start a new game for the changes in this mod to work correctly.

Partially Included Mods
========================================================
Hlaalu Rank Adjust by Ithilien87 - LDM includes only the NPC rank and "background" topic changes from Hlaalu Rank Adjust. Compatible if you load Hlaalu Rank Adjust after LDM - C&C for the full Hlaalu Rank Adjust changes.
Sexual Harassment Remover by JaceyS 
- I only included the quest changes/additions. SHR is incredibly modular, so you can pick and choose from any of the other SHR modules and load them alongside C&C, just don't use any of the modules that affect the Telvanni Bride quest, Crassius Curio, or Nels Llendo.

Compatibility
=======================================================
-- Django's Dialogue should load BEFORE LDM - Context Matters
-- Improved Inns Expanded should load BEFORE LDM - Choices and Consequences
-- Hlaalu Rank Adjust should load AFTER LDM - Choices and Consequences

Mods that Conflict
=======================================================
- Anything on the "included mods" list
- Andrano Ancestral Tomb Remastered - GAMA. Situational conflict where Nelos Onmar may become temporarily unavailable, thus leading to a dead end in the AATR quest. It is possible to still complete the Andrano quests via other methods.

Recommended Mods
========================================================
- MWSE Pickpocket and Stealth Improved by Mort - Makes pickpocketing and stealth actually functional, thus providing pacifist options in a LOT of different scenarios. 
- Roleplay Options for Great House Hlaalu by Caeris & Luj1
- Courtesy by Chantox
- Nationalist Nerevarine by Alice
- Religions Elaborated by Caeris - use the No Quest Changes version
