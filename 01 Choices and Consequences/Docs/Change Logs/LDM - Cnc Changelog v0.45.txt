Hlaalu Rank Adjust by Ithilien87 - LDM includes only the NPC rank and "background" topic changes from Hlaalu Rank Adjust. Compatible if you load Hlaalu Rank Adjust after LDM - C&C for the full Hlaalu Rank Adjust changes.
Sexual Harassment Remover by JaceyS 
- I only included the quest changes/additions. SHR is incredibly modular, so you can pick and choose from any of the other SHR modules and load them alongside C&C, just don't use any of the modules that affect the Telvanni Bride quest, Crassius Curio, or Nels Llendo.

Mods that Conflict
=======================================================
- Anything on the "included mods" list

- Roleplay Options for Great House Hlaalu by Caeris & Luj1
- Courtesy by Chantox
- Nationalist Nerevarine by Gavrilo93
- Religions Elaborated by Caeris - use the No Quest Changes version

High Level Feature Changes in 0.45
=======================================================
-- Gavrilo93's Redoran Freeloaders: Redoran now sleep for free at The Flowers of Gold, per vanilla dialogue. This is now filtered for PC Expelled = 0 too.
-- Gavrilo93's Blight at the Hairat-Vassamsi Mine: A warrior called Raynila Neryon is memorialised in Maar Gan. She fell while attempting to cleanse the Hairat-Vassamsi egg mine of blight. You can now complete her quest. The villagers will thank you, and miners will return to the mine.
-- Gavrilo93's Duel of Honor - Improve the Chances: Gives you the option to give Rothis Nethan a glass netch dagger to further improve his chances of winning the duel, since his Hlaalu opponent usually wins if he just has the standard potions of healing. 
--- Also gives you the option to give him quality or exclusive potions instead of standard ones. You only need to give him five quality/exclusive potions instead of ten.

============ Redoran Freeloaders ==============================
https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47321

-- Redoran sleep for free at the Flowers of Gold, per vanilla dialogue.

LDM changes:
-- minor dialogue tweaks
-- filtered for PC Expelled = 0, only Redoran in good standing with the House get to sleep for free.

============= Gavrilo93's Blight at the Hairat-Vassamsi Mine ==============
https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47589

-- Gives you the opportunity to complete Ravila's quest to cure the blighted kwama queen at the Hairat-Vassamsi mine. You don't have to be a member of House Redoran.

Changes in LDM:
-- some minor dialogue tweaks
-- Bolyrys -> Bolrys

=============== Gavrilo93's Duel of Honor - Improve the Chances  =============
https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47393

You can now improve Rothis Nethan's chances of winning the Duel of Honor by providing him with a good weapon - and receive word about a necromancer who should be killed at the same time.

Changes in LDM:
-- adds the option to give him quality or exclusive potions

[[ glass netch dagger ]]
-- adds a note about where to find a glass netch dagger, and points you in the direction of a necromancer (the ex-MG sorceress Anirne) as a bonus. Necromancer-killing is a wholesome Redoran-approved activity, kids.

[[ duel ]]
-- you now have the option to give him the vanilla 10 standard potions of healing, or 5 exquisite or quality potions instead.

[[ greeting 5 ]]
-- adds a failsafe journal entry in case the script fails to trigger.
