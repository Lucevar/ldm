Partially Included Mods
========================================================
Hlaalu Rank Adjust by Ithilien87 - LDM includes only the NPC rank and "background" topic changes from Hlaalu Rank Adjust. Compatible if you load Hlaalu Rank Adjust after LDM - C&C for the full Hlaalu Rank Adjust changes.
Sexual Harassment Remover by JaceyS 
- I only included the quest changes/additions. SHR is incredibly modular, so you can pick and choose from any of the other SHR modules and load them alongside C&C, just don't use any of the modules that affect the Telvanni Bride quest, Crassius Curio, or Nels Llendo.

Recommended Mods
========================================================
- MWSE Pickpocket by Mort - Makes pickpocketing actually functional, thus providing pacifist options in a LOT of different scenarios. 
- Roleplay Options for Great House Hlaalu by Caeris & Luj1
- Courtesy by Chantox
- Nationalist Nerevarine by Gavrilo93
- Religions Elaborated by Caeris - use the No Quest Changes version

High Level Feature Changes in 0.43
=======================================================
-- You can now build both the trader and the smithy at Raven Rock, if you pay for the construction yourself.
-- Fjol will now have his weapons and armor removed when he gets sent to jail.
-- Lugrub gro-Ogdum will no longer force greet you if he doesn't detect you.
-- Added options to leave peacefully (if you're not carrying the axe) or attempt to run past him without fighting so you can report to Darius (if you are)
-- Darius will no longer mention Lugrub having died honorably in the service of the Empire if its known that Mansilamat was murdered.
-- If you kill Lugrub without telling Darius about the murder first, and then turn up without proper evidence, he'll have you arrested for murder. If you're in the legion, you'll be expelled.
-- If you bring evidence to him after being arrested he'll have your name cleared, tho.
-- Widow Vabdas will acknowledge if you got yourself arrested in the course of helping her.
-- Darius's quest-related greetings are now filtered for Expelled = 0


Change List
=================================================
[Raven Rock: Setting Up Shop]
-- You now have the option to build both the smithy and the trader's outpost at Raven Rock. You'll have to pay the cost from your own pocket, though, and the building will take a bit longer.
