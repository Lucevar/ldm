Hlaalu Rank Adjust by Ithilien87 - LDM includes only the NPC rank and "background" topic changes from Hlaalu Rank Adjust. Compatible if you load Hlaalu Rank Adjust after LDM - C&C for the full Hlaalu Rank Adjust changes.
Sexual Harassment Remover by JaceyS 
- I only included the quest changes/additions. SHR is incredibly modular, so you can pick and choose from any of the other SHR modules and load them alongside C&C, just don't use any of the modules that affect the Telvanni Bride quest, Crassius Curio, or Nels Llendo.

Mods that Conflict
=======================================================
- Anything on the "included mods" list

Recommended Mods

- MWSE Pickpocket by Mort - Makes pickpocketing actually functional, thus providing pacifist options in a LOT of different scenarios.

- Courtesy by Chantox
- Nationalist Nerevarine by Gavrilo93
- Religions Elaborated by Caeris - use the No Quest Changes version

High Level Feature Changes in 0.44
=======================================================
=============== Libertarian Magical Services by Gavrilo93 =============
https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46301

-- 8 new NPCs who will appear after the House Telvanni quest Mages Guild Monopoly is completed successfully (HT_Monopoly 100). 6 are Telvanni, two are independent.
-- With a lack of regulation comes, well, a lack of regulation. Not all the new NPCs are as good as their word.

New NPCS:
Areach - Enchanter service - Gnisis, Madach Tradehouse
S'Ashi - thief - Khuul, Thongar's Tradehouse
Edrose Savos - Healer Service - Maar Gan
Falare Dalaril - Alchemist service - Ald Velothi
Ilverel Llondas - sorceror service - Ald-ruhn, Ald Skar Inn
Sevareni Llondas - nightblade service - Ald-ruhn, Ald Skar Inn
Therele Llalvi - mage service - Molag Mar
Urves Sedrith - battlemage service - Maar Gan, Andus Tradehouse 

Changes in LDM:
-- NPC names tweaked slightly to sound more Dunmeri.
-- The new NPCs will comment on the Mages Guild monopoly and what brings them to their new residence.
-- Some vanilla NPCs will comment on the Mages Guild monopoly and give their thoughts on the repeal.
-- More generic commentary on the repeal and what NPCs think of it - faction, class, location based.
-- Option to refuse Ranis's "unsanctioned training" quest if the monopoly has been repealed. You can now tell her she doesn't have the authority to do that.
-- Only-He-Stands-There will refuse to stop offering training if the monopoly has been repealed (with the very reasonable argument that YOU helped pass that law). If you still want to complete Ranis's quest you'll have to kill him. Ranis will be baffled but say there may be hope for you yet.
-- If the player previously persuaded Only-He-Stands-There to stop offering training for Ranis, he'll start offering training again after the monopoly is repealed. But not to the player, 'cuz you were a dick. ie his service refusal will change.
