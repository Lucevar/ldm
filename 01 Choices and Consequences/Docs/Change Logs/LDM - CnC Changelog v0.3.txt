https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47369

[[ MS_HentusPants ]]
[new] 90: decided to keep Hentus' pants
[new] 95: brought Hentus replacement pants
[new] 110: Hentus thanked me for returning his pants.

[[ greetings 5 ]]
-- Changed filter to MS_HentusPants < 90

[[ pants ]]
dealing with hainab:
-- original choice intact: raise his disposition to 80
-- new choice: as a member of the Legion in uniform, order Hentus to give the pants back
-- new choice: Intimidate Hainab into returning the pants [50 strength]
-- new choice: Convince Hainab the prank is in poor taste [45 speechcraft]
-- new reaction lines depending on how you complete the quest (keep pants, give replacement pair)

dealing with hentus:
-- new choice: gift him a pair of identical pants. He'll accept them if you insist, but you'll only get one hackle-lo as a reward instead of 3.
-- new choice: tell him the reward is inadequate and ask for more [60 speechcraft]
-- Choices are now dialogue rather than actions
-- Hentus' disposition will now drop if you decide to keep the pants. Keeping them will also finish the quest. Added a new reaction line if you do decide to keep them. 
-- added a new response at journal ms_hentuspants = 10 "Please hurry, this river is cold." rather than repeating the request to find the pants.

=== [West Gash: Pemenie and the Boots of Blinding Speed] ===
Integrates GAMA's changes with changes from Remiros's unreleased Quest Choices mod.

[[ MV_TraderAbandoned ]]
10: changes the note about where Pemenie is found from "west of Balmora" to "north-east of Caldera"
40-70: no longer used, but left in because deleting vanilla entries seems dicey. Functionality moved to GAMA_pricePemenie instead.
110: Changed from "While escorting Pemenie to Gnaar Mok" to "Pemenie the Trader met an unfortunate end" to fit several scenarios where she dies.
120: Finish quest. Made a deal with Pemenie and bought the boots.
130: Threaten to report Pemenie to the guards. Intimidate her into giving up the boots.
140: I tried to threaten Pemenie into giving me the boots, but I didn't pull it off.

[[ GAMA_PricePemenie ]]
Journal series tracking Pemenie bounty info.
-- change local updates about Pemenie's bounty to reference PricePemenie 5

5-8: Relocated vanilla MV_TraderAbandoned 40-70 to here to make it easier to track & refer to them in the quest choices
10: turn in the bounty. Finish.

[[ greeting 5 ]]
GAMA: new greeting for when Pemenie relocates to Zainsipilu.
Remiros QC: new greetings for journal entry 120 and 130

[[ making a deal ]]
-- new choice: "not yet, but maybe later"
-- new choice: buy the boots of blinding speed for 1000 gold, without escorting Pemenie.
-- new choice: if you've heard about her bounty (GAMA_PricePemenie 5), you can attempt to threaten her into giving you the boots. Requires Speechcraft > 40 to succeed.

[[ bounty ]]
GAMA: Adds responses in Caldera and Gnaar Mok about the consequences of her actions finally catching up to her. Adds a script to her attack response that prompts the player to collect her bounty once she's dead.
-- "there's a price on her head" -> "there's a price on Pemenie's head" in case the player gets access to the topic before meeting Pemenie and therefore has no idea who it's referring to.
-- Added a unique response for Verick Gemain, as the generic response doesn't flow well with his unique "someone in particular" line for Pemenie.

[[ someone in particular ]]
-- verick gemain will warn you about Pemenie's bounty

[[ Pemenie the Trader ]]
-- Added a unique response for Verick Gemain, as the generic response doesn't flow well with his unique "someone in particular" line for Pemenie.
-- You can collect the bounty on Pemenie from any guards who aren't Telvanni
-- Responses in Caldera and Gnaar Mok depending on whether or not Pemenie is alive
