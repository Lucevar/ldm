Partially Included Mods
========================================================
Hlaalu Rank Adjust by Ithilien87 - LDM includes only the NPC rank and "background" topic changes from Hlaalu Rank Adjust. Compatible if you load Hlaalu Rank Adjust after LDM - C&C for the full Hlaalu Rank Adjust changes.
Sexual Harassment Remover by JaceyS 
- I only included the quest changes/additions. SHR is incredibly modular, so you can pick and choose from any of the other SHR modules and load them alongside C&C, just don't use any of the modules that affect the Telvanni Bride quest, Crassius Curio, or Nels Llendo.

Compatibility
=======================================================
-- Django's Dialogue should load BEFORE LDM - Context Matters
-- Improved Inns Expanded should load BEFORE LDM - Choices and Consequences
-- Hlaalu Rank Adjust should load AFTER LDM - Choices and Consequences

Mods that Conflict
=======================================================
- Anything on the "included mods" list

Recommended Mods
========================================================
- MWSE Pickpocket by Mort - Makes pickpocketing actually functional, thus providing pacifist options in a LOT of different scenarios. 
- Roleplay Options for Great House Hlaalu by Caeris & Luj1
- Courtesy by Chantox
- Nationalist Nerevarine by Gavrilo93
- Religions Elaborated by Caeris - use the No Quest Changes version

High Level Feature Changes in 0.46
=======================================================
-- Conflict between Improved Inns Expanded and LDM/Redoran Freeloaders resolved.
-- Tweaked Nels Llendo's reaction to the PC having corprus
-- Filters for Vivec quest The Bad Actor changed so that hearing the rumor first doesn't lock you out of the quest.
-- Marcel Maurard is now standing about outside Miun-Gei's shop, being irritating, instead of wandering around aimlessly.
-- If Trerayna Dalen is dead, people in Tel Branora will no longer tell you about her camp if you ask about "someone in particular".
-- Imperial Cult topic Caryarel will now disappear after the quest, except for Kaye (and residents of Gnaar Mok if you killed him). Kaye and people in Gnaar Mok will now disapprove if you kill him. 
-- Fixes for Darius's "proof" topic

===== Vivec: The Bad Actor =============
-- Miun-Gei's quest greeting filtering changed so that it will appear even if the player has already heard the rumor about the quest. Before, hearing the rumor blocked the quest.
-- Marcel Maurard will give his greeting even before you've heard about the quest, because he's an annoying fool, he should be annoying people.
-- Marcel Maurard's wander radius set to 0, and he's moved to stand outside Miun-Gei's shop.

====== Imperial Legion: Land Deed =========
[[ proof ]]
-- The dialogue entries all got order-scrambled somehow in a previous version. This release puts them back in the proper order so the quest is completeable again.

========= Imperial Cult: Caryarel ============
-- Changes filters so that the topic disappears after the quest.
-- Except for the entry in Gnaar Mok when you've killed him. In that case, npcs now lose disposition.
-- Kaye also loses disposition if you killed Caryarel and bring him up again.
