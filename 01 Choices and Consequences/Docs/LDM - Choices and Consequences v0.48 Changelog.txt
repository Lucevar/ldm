Partially Included Mods
========================================================
Hlaalu Rank Adjust by Ithilien87 - LDM includes only the NPC rank and "background" topic changes from Hlaalu Rank Adjust. Compatible if you load Hlaalu Rank Adjust after LDM - C&C for the full Hlaalu Rank Adjust changes.
Sexual Harassment Remover by JaceyS 
- I only included the quest changes/additions. SHR is incredibly modular, so you can pick and choose from any of the other SHR modules and load them alongside C&C, just don't use any of the modules that affect the Telvanni Bride quest, Crassius Curio, or Nels Llendo.

Compatibility
=======================================================
-- Django's Dialogue should load BEFORE LDM - Context Matters
-- Improved Inns Expanded should load BEFORE LDM - Choices and Consequences
-- Hlaalu Rank Adjust should load AFTER LDM - Choices and Consequences

Mods that Conflict
=======================================================
- Anything on the "included mods" list
- Andrano Ancestral Tomb Remastered - GAMA. Situational conflict where Nelos Onmar may become temporarily unavailable, thus leading to a dead end in the AATR quest. It is possible to still complete the Andrano quests via other methods.

Recommended Mods
========================================================
- MWSE Pickpocket and Stealth Improved by Mort - Makes pickpocketing and stealth actually functional, thus providing pacifist options in a LOT of different scenarios. 
- Roleplay Options for Great House Hlaalu by Caeris & Luj1
- Courtesy by Chantox
- Nationalist Nerevarine by Alice
- Religions Elaborated by Caeris - use the No Quest Changes version

High Level Feature Changes in 0.48
=======================================================
* Made Larrius Varro rumors less annoying. The quest will now only appear in your quest list if you've actually started it.
* Hisin Deep-Raed will now move to Thirsk instead of an exterior cell once you cure him, for TOTSP compatibility.
* Hisin will get some armor along the way to his new home.  
* Added new greetings to Falanu and Drerel Indaren during and after Divided by Nix Hounds, since the generic greetings don't make sense mid-quest and were simply disappointing post-quest.  
* They'll also be a bit more grateful: you'll get a disposition boost with them now. 
* Hrisskar's corpse is now activatable  
* Added a more explicit pointer to Hla Oad in the journal entry you get when you find Hrisskar's corpse
* Added Khajiiti versions of the Hla Oad dialogue talking about Hrisskar. 
* You now have the option of curing Din with a potion instead of a spell or by taking him to Gnisis Temple.
* Din will now move to Fort Darius instead of Madach Tradehouse after the quest (unless you take him to the Temple), for better compatibility with HOTV and BCOM. 
* Some tweaks to dialogue in the extended Beauty and the Bandit quest. 

===================== Fargoth's Hiding Place ===================
* Hrisskar dead journal entry: pointer to Hla Oad to find out what happened
* Hrisskar's corpse is now activatable  
* Added Khajiit versions of the dialogue lines about Hrisskar in Hla Oad.  
* Added nolore filter to Hrisskar Flat-Foot topic entries.

==================== Town_Balmora: Larrius Varro Tells A Little Story ================
Makes the Larrius Varro rumors slightly less annoying:
* Town_Balmora 1: Checked finished so that it doesn't open the quest in the quest list when you get this rumor.
* Town_Balmora 5: Checked finished so that it doesn't open the quest in the quest list when you get this rumor.
* Town_Balmora 10: Checked restart so that it opens the quest if you got one of the other rumors before getting this entry.
* Town_Balmora 15: Checked restart so that it opens the quest if you got one of the other rumors before getting this entry.
You can still do the quest, marking it as "Finished" only makes it so that it doesn't clutter your quest list.

==================== Ashlands: Divided by Nix Hounds ===================
* [Greeting 5] Added a greeting to Drerel Indaren when he is following you, to prevent him giving you generic low/high disposition greetings despite having asked you for help
* [Greeting 1] Edited Drerel's greeting when Falanu is dead slightly: it is now less abrupt
* [Greeting 1] Added greetings to Falanu and Drerel once they move to the Ald Skar Inn that acknowledge that you helped them. Different lines for disposition over/under 30.  
* [Greeting 5] Added greetings to Drerel and Falanu after the quest is complete but before they move to Ald Skar.
* Drerel and Falanu will be less ungrateful now: you'll get a disposition boost for rescuing them.

==================== West Gash: The Paralysed Barbarian ====================
* Hisin Deep-Raed will now move to Thirsk instead of an outside cell, for compatibility with TOTSP.  
* Made sure Hisin Deep-Raed moves along after his quest is complete
* Gave Hisin some extra armor when he moves to Thirsk
* Changed choices in enchant topic to say "cure this disease" rather than "cure your paralysation", as the vanilla dialogue suggests that you need to find him a cure paralysation potion instead of the correct cure disease potion.

=================== The Man Who Spoke To Slaughterfish ===============
* Added option to cure Din with a potion 
* Changed where Din goes after curing him in the wilderness. He will now move to Fort Darius instead of Madach's Tradehouse. This will ensure compatibility with HOTV and BCOM.

Topics: [muddled], [cast that spell]

=================== Beauty and the Bandit ====================
* Edited some dialogue to bring action indicators more in line with vanilla style, ie *sob*, *hic* instead of <sob>, <hic>
