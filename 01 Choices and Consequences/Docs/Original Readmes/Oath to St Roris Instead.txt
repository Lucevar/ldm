===== Gavrilo93's Oath To St Roris Instead =============
https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47339

I'm roleplaying an Ordinator character right now, who is a fanatic believer of the Tribunal Temple and loathes everything connected to the Empire. However, she is also a good person and helps people whenever she can. She was on her way back from a Sixth House shrine, when she stumbled upon a trader who asked her to deliver a shipment of weapons to Ald-ruhn. I wanted to accept the quest, but then he asked my Ordinator to swear an oath to Zenithar, the god of the n'wah. Therefore, the best that I could do was rejecting the errand, and imagining that she says that she wishes to help, but swearing such an oath would be against her principles.

I thought that it would be nice to complete this quest as a Tribunal faithful too, so I made this mod. It allows you to tell the traders in the quests, The Weapon Delivery﻿ and The Shirt of His Back﻿ that you wouldn't swear an oath to Zenithar, but you would gladly swear an oath to Saint Roris instead. As you may know, Saint Roris﻿ was a trader﻿, who refused to denounce his faith in Almsivi when the Argonians captured him. While it seems that traders themselves don't have a patron saint in the Temple, this particular saint seems to be the most suitable, as he is the patron saint of caravaners, and he was a trader himself in life. Also, depending on your imagination, it may add another layer to your character's response, when they talk with the Argonian trader.

The mod is clean, and should be compatible with pretty much every other mod.

Bugs:

This mod is bug-free. If you refuse Lucan Ostorius' errand, and he attacks you when you leave Ald-ruhn, that's a vanilla bug, not a bug caused by this mod. Please don't bother me with that.

Changelog:

Version 1.1.: A little adjustment for the "Service Refusal" dialogue which occurs in Ald-ruhn, if you haven't delivered the shirts in "The Shirt of His Back" quest, to fit the new option better.
