Description
===========

Bothered by the fact that Drerel and Falanu Indaren spend the remainder of the game in the same spot outside Ald'ruhn after being reunited? Does your heart ache for Rollie being left to wait indefinitely on the crossroads near Vivec? Well, this is the mod for you!

=========================================
Following quests and NPCs covered by GAMA
=========================================

The following NPCs will relocate/disable when your character changes cells.

"Divided by Nix Hounds": Drerel and Falanu Indaren will relocate to the Ald Skar Inn upon completion of the quest; Drerel will be killed and Falanu disabled if the quest is refused.

"The Beauty and the Bandit": Happily ever after? Heartbreak and misery? Somewhere in between? Find out what happens with Maurrie Aurmine and Nelos Onmar!

"The Scholars and the Mating Kagouti": Edras Onil and Thoronor will relocate to Desele's House of Earthly Delights (much to Edras' chagrin) upon completion of the quest. If either of them dies, the other will be disabled. The player will also give Edras his notes that were dropped ("Notes - Kagouti Mating Habits") if in your possession during the quest (given to Thoronor if Edras dies before giving the notes to him).

"To the Fields of Kummu": Nevrasa Dralor will relocate to Suran Temple upon completion of the quest.

"An Escort to Molag Mar": Paur Maston and Vanjirra are disabled if you refuse to escort Paur or if either one of them dies. They will both relocate to The Pilgrim's Rest to conduct their business upon completion of the quest.

"A Man and His Guar": If both survive, Rollie and Teris Raledran will relocate to Balmora upon completion of the quest. You will also have to escort Teris into Agrippina Herennia's shop for the quest to complete (opposed to outside the shop as in vanilla MW).

"The Bad Actor": Marcel Maurard has been relocated upon completion of the quest. I'll leave it up for you to guess where he will reside, muffin...

"Recovering Cloudcleaver": Sosia Caristiana will relocate to Guild of Mages in Caldera if you side with her; Hlormar Wine-Sot will relocate to Shenk's Shovel if you choose to side with him, otherwise he will be disabled if you decline to help him search for Cloudcleaver.

"Aeta Wave-Breaker's Jewels": Aeta Wave-Breaker is relocated to Shenk's Shovel upon completion of the quest.

"The Paralyzed Barbarian": Hisin Deep-Raed goes on holiday to Solstheim after his ordeal.

"Viatrix, The Annoying Pilgrim": Viatrix Petilia will relocate to the Tower of Dusk upon completion of the quest.

"The Weapon Delivery": Lucan Ostorius will relocate to the South Wall Cornerclub upon completion of the quest; Lucan will be disabled if you decline the quest.

"The Shirt of His Back": Rasha will relocate to Fara's Hole in the Wall upon completion of the quest.

"The Man Who Spoke to Slaughterfish": Din is disabled if you decline to help; relocated to Madach Tradehouse if your character heals him; stays at Gnisis Temple if taken to be healed.

"Kidnapped by Cultists": Malexa and Sason will relocate to Thongar's Tradehouse upon completion of the quest; Malexa is sacrificed and Sason will be disabled if you decline to help Malexa escape.

"Pemenie and the Boots of Blinding Speed": Pemenie will relocate to Zainsipilu upon completion of the quest or if you decline to help her. You will also be able to collect a bounty on her from guards (sans the Telvanni. Why should they care, eh?) once the topics "bounty" and "Pemenie the trader" become available, and after she's dead.

"Marsus Tullius' Missing Hides": Marsus Tullius will join his father, Stentus Tullius, in Tel Aruhn upon completion of the quest; Marsus will be disabled and Stentus will remain in Tel Aruhn if you decline the quest.

"Girith's Stolen Hides": As Athanden Girith knows Almsivi Intervention, he will relocate to the temple in Ald'ruhn if you decline the quest or upon completing the quest.

"The Mad Lord of Milk": Delyna Mandas will relocate to the outpost in Ald Velothi after being rescued.

"Widowmaker": After you leave the area, Botrir will go to look for the witch if you decline the quest... and it could very well end badly for him.

"Lead the Pilgrim to Koal Cave": Fonus Rathryon will relocate to Gnisis Temple upon completion of the quest.

"The Angry Trader": Tinos Drothan will relocate to The Flowers of Gold upon completion of the quest, otherwise will be disabled if you refuse the quest.

"Tul's Escape": Tul is relocated to the guardhouse on Dren Plantation if Sterdecan is already dead or killed during the quest.
